Pointer is a variable that holds the addres of some object.
Like in the real life, when we want to do a party we share the address of the house for our guests.
But in C we have the address of a integer, a string etc.

If I create a pointer to something all I'm doing is storing the memory address in a variable.
Pointers are powerful because we can access and use the object that's being pointed to by the pointer.

Example:

int main(int argc, char * argv[]) {
    byte * pBkgndColor = (byte *) 53281;

    *pBkgndColor = 0;

    return 0
}

In this example we are declaring a pointer to a byte, the name of this pointer is pBkgndColor.
I have said to my program that "53281" has a type of a memory address.
Then I acess the value that the pointer points and change the value of it to 0.
*pBkgndColor means the content of the memory location 53281.
